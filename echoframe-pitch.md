## THE CRISIS IN RISK ANALYSIS

### High-Profile Due Diligence Failures

* **Stenn** ($900M fintech collapsed after Russian money laundering allegations)
* **FTX** (Complete investor due diligence failure before $32B collapse)
* **Wirecard** (Prolonged fraud despite Big Four oversight)
* **Danske Bank Estonia** (â‚¬200B money laundering scandal missed by compliance systems)

---

## WHY DUE DILIGENCE IS FAILING

### The 5 Critical Contributing Factors

#### 1. Pressure to Close Deals Quickly
* **Real Impact:** WeWork's rushed IPO overlooked governance issues leading to $40B valuation loss
* **Market Reality:** 73% of M&A professionals report increased pressure to accelerate due diligence timelines

#### 2. Digital Transformation Introducing New Risks
* **Real Impact:** SolarWinds breach affected thousands of organizations with no framework to assess supply chain software risk
* **Market Reality:** 64% of companies report gaps between digital transformation initiatives and risk assessment capabilities

#### 3. Remote Work Transition
* **Real Impact:** Wirecard collapse partly enabled by auditors unable to physically verify cash reserves
* **Market Reality:** 58% of risk managers report decreased visibility into operations since remote work expansion

#### 4. Geopolitical Complexity
* **Real Impact:** Nord Stream 2 investments stranded due to sanctions, costing billions
* **Market Reality:** Cross-border transactions increased 34% while regional risk expertise declined 18%

#### 5. Cost-Cutting Measures
* **Real Impact:** Deutsche Bank compliance cutbacks preceded multiple regulatory actions
* **Market Reality:** Risk and compliance budgets flat or decreasing at 47% of financial institutions despite increasing complexity

---

## WHY RISK ADVISORY SERVICES FALL SHORT

### The 4 Critical Limitations

#### 1. Methodology Limitations
* **Real Impact:** Credit rating agencies gave AAA ratings to ultimately worthless mortgage-backed securities
* **Market Reality:** 68% of risk models remain backward-looking and rule-based in a world demanding predictive, adaptive approaches

#### 2. Data Silos
* **Real Impact:** HSBC's segregated systems allowed cross-jurisdictional money laundering to go undetected
* **Market Reality:** Average enterprise uses 16+ disparate systems containing risk-relevant data with minimal integration

#### 3. Staffing Challenges
* **Real Impact:** VC firms lacking crypto expertise failed to detect fundamental problems at FTX
* **Market Reality:** 82% shortage in professionals with combined regional expertise and technical risk assessment skills

#### 4. Client Resistance
* **Real Impact:** BP Deepwater Horizon management repeatedly overrode safety concerns before catastrophic spill
* **Market Reality:** 71% of risk professionals report having warnings discounted by management due to commercial pressures
